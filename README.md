# Placement-Cell
The placement cell is an application built for colleges. 
We use HTML, CSS, PHP, and JAVASCRIPT for the front end and MY SQL for the back end. 
It contains two modules: User and admin. If an unknown user, he must register and upload all the required details. 
This application includes all details about upcoming and ongoing placements in the college. 
This application will also contain the details of the students who have applied for the placement drive.
 Placement Cell in an educational institution typically manages the placement activities, including coordinating with recruiters, organizing placement drives, and helping students prepare for interviews. Below is a simple Java code example for a basic Placement Cell management system. This code includes basic functionalities like adding companies, adding students, and displaying placement details.
 This is a basic console-based application. Depending on your requirements, you may want to enhance this code with features like updating company or student information, handling multiple batches, integrating with databases, or implementing a GUI.
